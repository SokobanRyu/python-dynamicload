# Python 3.7 Dynamic Load Example

How to load your code dynamycaly is one commonly discussed topic for Python. There are multiple stackoverflow discussions about this and the methods for dynamic loading have developed over time with the development of the Python versions. In Python 3 the magic methods for modules were introduced and and they became even better in Python 3.7. When would you need to load dynamically your Python code?

* Building plugins
* Whenever your have a huge codebase, but you do not need all your code loaded in the memory all the time
* You need to choose which part of your code to be loaded during import time
* You even may need to load choosen parts of your code during runtime

## Getting Started

TODO: These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python >= 3.7

### How to Create Your Own Dynamic Loaded Python Package

TODO: A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
